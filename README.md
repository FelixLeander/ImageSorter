# ImageSorter

## Note
### Very early in development, everything is subject to change.
### Priority is basic functionality. Looks and everything else comes later.
### An app which QUICKLY lets you decide what to do with specific kinds of data.
### I'll keep everyone posted [here][RedditSource].

## Planned features (in likly order of apperance):
- Custom folder location
- MultiFolder (+FolderGroup)
- Toggle cut/copy
- Different ways of sorting
- Custom file support (likely no or limited preview)
- Restore deleted (shit go back button)

#### Will be focused on Android 10 & 11
